      <h1>About Our Vision</h1>
      <h2>Local Food App</h2>
      <p> 
        Founded in 2022, a group of IT students from UMB discovered a passion for food. They built this website with the goal 
        of finding the best and most accessible grub around. Most students are plopped down in a new city with no car, and they don't
        know what is available nearby.
        </p>
        <p>
        That's where our Local Food app comes in. Searching for your location will result in nearby restaurants being displayed, including 
        reviews pulled straight from Google's Places API. We also allow for users of the site to post their own reviews. This allows for 
        further transparency as these won't include paid reviews nor will we be removing reviews as long as they are respectful.
        Our vision is to help our users make informed decisions when looking for local food option in a new place.
